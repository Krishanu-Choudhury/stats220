## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

1) I am undertaking a degree in **Bachelor of Science majoring in 
   Mathematics and Statistics**.
2) I am taking STATS 220 because it is a required course for my Statistics 
   major. Additionally, I have a strong interest in the applied and data 
   analysis aspects of Statistics, and this course will equip me with the essential skills needed to succeed in the industry.
3) I am interested in learning about different data technologies that are relevant in today's *Data Science and Analytics industry*.
