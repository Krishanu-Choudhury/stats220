# 📊 Data Analysis Projects: Consumer Data & Liquor Stores and Schools

This repository showcases two data analysis projects completed using R as part of the University of Auckland's STATS 220 course. The projects focus on trends in consumer shopping behavior and an investigation into whether the proximity of liquor stores (within 1 km) influences the total donations received by English-medium secondary schools in the Auckland region.

## 🏫 2. Liquor Stores & Secondary Schools (R)

**Objective**:  
To examine the total donations received by English-medium secondary schools in the Auckland Council area, and assess whether this amount is associated with:
- Liquor Stores Proximity (within 1 km radius of the schools)
- Differences in donations between single-sex and co-educational schools

**Tools**:  
- R (`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`)
