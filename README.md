# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science majoring in Mathematics and Statistics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because it is a required course for my Statistics major. Additionally, I have a strong interest in the applied and data analysis aspects of Statistics, and this course will equip me with the essential skills needed to succeed in the industry.
- I am interested in learning about different data technologies that are relevant in today's Data Science and Analytics industry.
